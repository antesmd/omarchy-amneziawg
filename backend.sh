# NetworkManager backend for the Omarchy WireGuard widget.
#
# Everything runs as the invoking user: tunnel control goes through
# NetworkManager over D-Bus, authorized by polkit (an active local session
# has network-control and settings.modify.system without a password on
# stock Omarchy). No sudo, no root shell — and unlike wg-quick, nothing
# here ever eval()s config content, so a config file is data, not code.
#
# Profiles are addressed by UUID everywhere: NetworkManager allows several
# connections with the same name, and names can contain characters that are
# unsafe to round-trip through nmcli's terse output.
#
# Secrets (PrivateKey, PresharedKey) are fed to `nmcli connection edit` on
# stdin, never passed as arguments — argv is world-readable in /proc.
#
# Mutating commands serialize on a per-user flock: the bar builds one widget
# instance per monitor, so two connects can race each other into "exclusive"
# tunnels that are anything but.
#
# Commands:
#   status                      list connections + active wireguard UUIDs
#   details <uuid> [ifname]     key=value facts for the detail grid (tunnel
#                               address, peer endpoint, allowed IPs, DNS,
#                               MTU, peer count). Reads no secrets.
#   connect <uuid>              transactional exclusive switch. Exit 0: only
#                               the target is active. Exit 20: the switch
#                               failed and the previously active tunnels were
#                               restored. Exit 21: the switch failed and the
#                               rollback was incomplete — the resulting state
#                               is unknown.
#   down <uuid>                 deactivate one profile

#                               and reconnects if it was active. Exit 5 means
#                               the profile was saved but reconnecting failed;
